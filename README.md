# Edutor

We are building the intelligence layer for learning. Our mission is to personalize learning for every student and support every teacher with real assistance. We do not want to replace teachers. We want to make teaching personal at scale.

## ✨ What is Edutor

Edutor is an Agentic OS for K12 education. It is a system of AI agents supporting teachers and students in real time. It helps teachers teach better and students learn better. It adapts to each student and each context.

We believe current EdTech is built like content dump platforms. They digitized textbooks. Students still learn alone and teachers still cannot personalize for 40 plus students. We are fixing this by building intelligence instead of content storage.

## 🎯 Mission

Make learning personal at scale. Build the AI infrastructure that understands every student and helps teachers guide them with the right method, pace, style, language, and practice.

## 🚀 What we are building

We're not building another content platform. We're building an operating system of AI agents that work together to personalize every aspect of teaching and learning. There is Suite of agent for teachers and same   Suite of Agents for students. Together they create an Agentic OS.

### What is the Agentic OS of Education

It is a group of specialized agents connected with a memory system and personalization engine. These agents support every action inside teaching and learning.

The whole agent system works on top of our memory architecture called Smriti. It builds micro brains of each student and teacher so we can adapt learning in real time.

## 🌟 Our Unique Approach

Make Personal Tutor ❌

Make Tutor Personal ✅

> We're not trying to replace teachers. We're making the teaching process personal for every student.

**The insight:** As AI intelligence becomes abundant and cheap, every student can learn at their own pace. But learning alone creates gaps - no inspiration, no challenge, no human touch.

**Our bet:** Teachers freed from repetitive content delivery will finally do what only humans can - inspire, challenge, and truly know each student.

The teacher becomes an orchestrator. AI handles personalization at scale. Students get individualized attention. Teachers focus on what matters.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

The core of our system is memory. We're building "Smriti" - our novel memory architecture that creates micro brains for every student and teacher on Edutor.

It stores and updates student learning state, patterns, gaps, behavior, past attempts, strengths, weaknesses, and teacher context. It powers personalized plans and actions.

Here is the exact final section to attach at the end of the README. It is written plain, direct, no noise, no em dash.
